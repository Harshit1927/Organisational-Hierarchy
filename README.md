# Organisational-Hierarchy
To run the code, put all four files (main.cpp, idexceptio.h, notempty.h, price.cpp) in one folder and then run main.cpp.

*main.cpp* file contains a sample test case using which it tests the code written in price.cpp file.

Make sure to run the Files in C++17 or newer version as the code was written for C++17 only.
